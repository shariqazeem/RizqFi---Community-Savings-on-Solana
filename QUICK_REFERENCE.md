## üìã COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### "How do you handle disputes?"
**Answer**: "Smart contract is the final arbiter - rules are coded and enforced automatically. All transactions are transparent on Solana blockchain, so there's complete accountability."

### "What if someone doesn't pay?"
**Answer**: "Payouts don't happen until all members contribute for that round. The smart contract enforces this - no exceptions. This ensures fairness automatically."

### "Why Solana over Ethereum?"
**Answer**: "Speed and cost. Solana has 400ms blocks and sub-cent fees. For users in Pakistan doing frequent transactions, this is critical. Plus, USDC is native on Solana."

### "What's your go-to-market strategy?"
**Answer**: "We're starting with Pakistani diaspora and urban early adopters. Word of mouth is powerful in committee culture. We'll partner with community leaders for credibility, then scale to mainstream."

### "How do you make money?"
**Answer**: "0.5% platform fee on payouts. At scale (10K users), that's $50K+ MRR. We also plan premium features and partnership revenue."

### "What about regulations?"
**Answer**: "We're working with local legal advisors to ensure compliance. Since we're not custodial (users control their wallets), we're in a better position than traditional committee organizers."

### "Have you tested with real users?"
**Answer**: "Yes! We've had [X] beta testers try the app. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive - they love the transparency and automation. [Share specific quote if available]"
