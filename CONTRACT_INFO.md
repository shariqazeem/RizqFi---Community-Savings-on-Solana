## üìä HOW TO TRACK TRANSACTIONS

### 1. After Creating a Committee:
When you create a committee in your app, you'll get a transaction signature. Example:
```
3x7F8kZjQJNHKx9mZ...
```

**Track it here**:
```
https://explorer.solana.com/tx/[YOUR_TX_SIGNATURE]?cluster=devnet
```

**Replace `[YOUR_TX_SIGNATURE]` with your actual transaction hash**

---

### 2. View All Program Activity:
To see ALL transactions happening on your smart contract:

**Solana Explorer**:
```
https://explorer.solana.com/address/ABKnVQCt2ATkMivkFux7X3zKnozHzXELc2LiUdZM8vCN?cluster=devnet
```
Click on "Transactions" tab

---

### 3. Track Specific Committee PDA:
Each committee has its own PDA (Program Derived Address).

Example: If committee PDA is `7xYz...ABC`

**Track it**:
```
https://explorer.solana.com/address/7xYz...ABC?cluster=devnet
```

You can get PDAs from your app's console logs or transaction details.

## üí° PRO TIPS FOR DEMO

### Show Transparency in Video:

1. **Before Transaction**:
   - Show your wallet balance
   - Show committee state

2. **Do Transaction**:
   - Create committee / Join / Contribute
   - Get transaction signature

3. **Prove It's On-Chain**:
   - Open Solana Explorer with TX signature
   - Show: "Success" status
   - Show: Block number
   - Show: Timestamp
   - Point to your Program ID

4. **After Transaction**:
   - Show updated state in app
   - Show updated balance

**This proves**: It's not fake, it's actually on Solana blockchain!

---

## üé§ WHAT TO SAY IN VIDEO

When showing the transaction:

> "And here's the transaction on Solana Explorer. You can see it's confirmed on the blockchain - block [number], at [timestamp]. Every transaction is public and verifiable. This is the transparency that traditional committees lack. Anyone can audit this."

**Point to Program ID**:
> "This is our smart contract address. All RizqFi transactions go through this program. You can track any committee, any contribution, any payout - all transparent."

---

## üìä EXAMPLE TRANSACTIONS TO SHOW

### Good Examples for Demo:

1. **Committee Creation**:
   - Shows program interaction
   - Creates new PDA accounts
   - Initializes committee state

2. **USDC Contribution**:
   - Shows token transfer
   - From member wallet ‚Üí vault
   - Updates committee balance

3. **Payout Distribution**:
   - Shows automated payout
   - From vault ‚Üí member
   - Proves no middleman

**Each proves different aspect of your solution!**

---

## üîê SECURITY NOTE

**Your Program ID is Public** - This is GOOD!

- ‚úÖ Shows transparency
- ‚úÖ Anyone can verify your contract
- ‚úÖ Proves it's on-chain
- ‚úÖ Builds trust with judges

**Keep Your Wallet Private Key Secret** - Obviously!

## üéØ WHY THIS MATTERS FOR WINNING

Judges look for:

1. **Transparency** ‚úÖ
   - "Here's our contract address"
   - "Anyone can verify"
   - Shows you're not hiding anything

2. **Technical Competence** ‚úÖ
   - Deployed to real blockchain
   - Working on Devnet
   - Real transactions happening

3. **Trust** ‚úÖ
   - On-chain = verifiable
   - Can't fake blockchain transactions
   - Shows you understand Web3

**Showing your contract address + live transactions = MAJOR credibility boost!**

---

## üìû TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I can't find my transaction signature"
- Check your browser console after transaction
- Look for logs like: `Transaction confirmed: 3x7F8k...`
- Your app should show it in the success toast

### "Explorer shows 'Not Found'"
- Make sure you added `?cluster=devnet` at the end
- Wait 1-2 seconds after transaction
- Refresh the page

### "How do I get my committee PDA?"
- It's derived from: `["committee", counter]`
- Check console logs when creating committee
- Or fetch from your program using Anchor client

### "Can judges verify this works?"
- YES! They can visit your Explorer link
- They can see all historical transactions
- They can verify it's really on Solana

---

## üèÜ FINAL TIP

**In your video**, when you show a transaction on Explorer, zoom in slightly and say:

> "This is the proof. Real transaction, real blockchain, real transparency. This is what trust looks like in Web3."

**Powerful moment. Judges will remember this.**
