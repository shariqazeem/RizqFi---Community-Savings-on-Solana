## üí° LIGHTING SETUP

### Best Setup (3-Point Lighting):
1. **Key Light**: Main light at 45¬∞ to your left
2. **Fill Light**: Softer light at 45¬∞ to your right
3. **Back Light**: Light behind you pointing at your shoulders (separates you from background)

### Budget Setup:
1. **Window Light**: Sit facing a window (natural light on your face)
2. **Lamp**: Add desk lamp to side for fill
3. **Time**: Record during golden hour (morning/late afternoon)

### Ring Light Setup (Recommended):
1. **Position**: Ring light directly in front, at eye level
2. **Distance**: 2-3 feet from your face
3. **Settings**: Warm white (3200K-3500K), medium brightness

### Pro Tips:
- **Avoid overhead lighting** (creates shadows under eyes)
- **Avoid backlighting** (don't sit with window behind you)
- **Test before recording** - take a photo/test video to check lighting
- **Eye level camera** - not looking up or down

---

## üé§ AUDIO TIPS

### Microphone Placement:
- **Distance**: 6-12 inches from your mouth
- **Position**: Slightly below mouth level, angled up
- **Angle**: Point at your mouth, not your chest

### Room Treatment:
- **Record in small room** (less echo)
- **Add soft materials** - blankets, pillows, curtains absorb sound
- **Avoid hard surfaces** - close doors, move away from walls
- **Turn off fans/AC** - eliminate background noise

### Recording Tips:
1. **Test your levels** - speak normally, check for clipping
2. **Room tone** - record 5 seconds of silence (for editing)
3. **Do multiple takes** - you can edit together the best parts
4. **Speak clearly** - enunciate, don't mumble
5. **Pace yourself** - not too fast, pause between thoughts

### Pro Tip: Noise Reduction
If you have background noise:
- Use Audacity (free) for noise reduction
- Use Krisp.ai (free trial) for real-time noise cancellation
- Use OBS noise suppression filter

---

## üìê FRAMING YOUR FACE

### Camera Position:
- **Height**: Eye level or slightly above (not below - double chin angle)
- **Distance**: Arm's length away
- **Angle**: Straight on or very slightly to side

### Frame Composition:
- **Headroom**: Small gap above your head (not too much)
- **Eye Line**: Your eyes at top third of frame
- **Background**: Clean, uncluttered (bookshelf is classic)
- **Rule of thirds**: Your face slightly off-center

### What to Wear:
- **Solid colors** - avoid patterns (can cause moir√© effect)
- **Contrast with background** - don't blend in
- **Business casual** - collared shirt or nice top
- **Avoid logos** - unless it's RizqFi merch!

### Expression:
- **Relaxed** but **passionate**
- **Smile naturally** - especially at beginning and end
- **Eye contact** - look at camera lens, not screen
- **Energy** - 20% more than normal conversation
