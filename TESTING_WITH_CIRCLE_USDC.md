## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Insufficient USDC balance"

- Check that you're on Solana Devnet, not mainnet

### Issue: "Token account doesn't exist"

**Solution:**
- The app should create it automatically
- Make sure you have enough SOL for rent (~0.002 SOL)
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting wallet

### Issue: "Transaction failed"

**Solution:**
- Check you have enough SOL for gas fees
- Make sure you're on Solana Devnet
- Try again (sometimes RPC nodes are slow)
- Check browser console for error messages

### Issue: "Can't see USDC in wallet"

**Solution:**
- Add the token manually using the address above
- Switch to Solana Devnet in your wallet
- Refresh your wallet
- Check transaction on Solana Explorer to confirm transfer

### Issue: "Circle faucet not working"

**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes and try again (rate limits)
