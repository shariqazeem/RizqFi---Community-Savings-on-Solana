## 🎯 The Problem

Every month, **50 million+ Pakistanis** participate in traditional "committee" savings:

- 💰 **$2 billion+** flows through informal committees annually
- 🤝 **30 million households** rely on committees for savings
- ⚠️ **40% report trust issues** with organizers
- 😢 **Money disappears**, records are faked, savings are lost

### Real Stories, Real Pain

*"My committee organizer collected $5,000 from 10 families and disappeared. We had no proof, no recourse. My daughter's school fees were in that money."* - Amina, Karachi

Traditional committees rely on **ONE PERSON** to:
- ✅ Collect everyone's monthly payments
- ✅ Decide who gets paid when
- ✅ Keep accurate records
- ✅ Distribute payouts fairly

**When that trust breaks, entire communities lose their savings.**

## 💡 Our Solution

**RizqFi eliminates the middleman with Solana smart contracts.**

### How It Works

1. **Create Committee** → Set amount, duration, members on-chain
2. **Members Join** → Automatic verification, transparent membership
3. **Monthly Contributions** → USDC deposits via smart contract
4. **Automatic Payouts** → No human intervention, 100% transparent
5. **Complete History** → Every transaction recorded on Solana blockchain

### Key Features

✅ **Zero Trust Required** - Smart contracts enforce all rules
✅ **Complete Transparency** - Every deposit and payout visible on-chain
✅ **Automated Payouts** - No organizer needed, no human error
✅ **Multi-Committee Support** - Manage multiple savings groups
✅ **Real-Time Tracking** - See contributions, progress, and health scores
✅ **Mobile-Ready** - Beautiful UI works on all devices

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Rust & Anchor CLI
- Solana CLI
- Phantom/Solflare wallet
- Testnet USDC from Circle Faucet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rizqfi.git
cd rizqfi

# Install frontend dependencies
cd rizqfi-frontend
npm install

# Install smart contract dependencies
cd ../anchor
anchor build
```

### Getting Testnet USDC

RizqFi now uses **Circle's official USDC token** on Solana Devnet. This means anyone can get testnet USDC for free!

**Step 1: Get Your Wallet Address**
1. Install Phantom or Solflare wallet
2. Switch to Solana Devnet
3. Copy your wallet address

**Step 2: Get Testnet USDC**

**Option A: Circle Faucet (Recommended)**
1. Visit [Circle's USDC Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/)
2. Paste your Solana wallet address
3. Click "Get USDC" to receive testnet tokens

**Option B: Circle Sandbox (More USDC)**
1. Sign up at [Circle Mint Sandbox](https://app-sandbox.circle.com/)
2. Follow the [Circle USDC transfer tutorial](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/transfer-usdc-on-solana-devnet)
3. Use the mock wire transfer to get larger amounts of testnet USDC

**USDC Token Details**:
- **Devnet Address**: `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU`
- **Network**: Solana Devnet
- **Decimals**: 6

**Step 3: Add USDC Token to Your Wallet**
1. In your Phantom/Solflare wallet, go to token management
2. Add custom token with address: `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU`
3. You should now see your USDC balance
