and disappeared. We had no proof."

## 🎯 PRESENTATION TIPS

### Before Presenting:

4. **Have demo ready** - In case they ask for live demo

### During Presentation:
1. **Start with the problem** - Hook them emotionally
2. **Show passion** - You BELIEVE in this
3. **Make eye contact** - Connect with judges
4. **Speak clearly** - Don't rush

- "Why Solana?" → Speed, low fees, growing in Pakistan
- "What's your user acquisition strategy?" → Word of mouth, community leaders
- "How do you make money?" → 0.5% fee model explained
- "What about regulations?" → Working with local legal advisors
